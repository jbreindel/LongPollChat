longPollChat
============

A long polling chat server and client. Please note that there are some other projects that are needed or desired for this to function properly. I didn't want to distribute their code because I am unsure of their licencing agreements. But Some of the projects are listed below:

<code>
1. jQuery       http://jquery.com/
2. moment.js    http://momentjs.com/
3. titlealert   https://github.com/heyman/jquery-titlealert
</code>

Written within the osTicket system:

<code>
1. osTicket     http://osticket.com/
</code>

Please note you need to provide a user class in chat.inc.php. I have it in the code as 

<code>$user->getName()</code>
